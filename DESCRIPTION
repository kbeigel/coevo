Description: Provides wrapper functions for common tests of coevolution. Methods such as ParaFit and PACo are often use for testing the cophylogenetic signal by evaluating the cophenetic distances of host-parasite (or host-symbiont) trees. Researchers often want to run multiple types of tests and compare them, so `coevo` provides an easier way to run these tests and compare results.
